# Google Apps Script Speak and Spell (work in progress)
Simple ["Speak and Spell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_\(toy\)) implementation
using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).

## Features
* Fun experiment with the Web Speech API.

## TODO
* Currently just have the "spell" mode working.  Needs a "speak" mode as well.
* Use speech recognition in the "speak" mode to listen to the user's response.
